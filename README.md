IoT-Based Electric Power Theft Detection System

By Odunayo Lydia  
Final-year Computer Engineering Student | Nigeria


 Project Overview
Electric power theft is a major challenge in Nigeria and other developing countries. This project proposes an **IoT-Based Electric Power Theft Detection System** that uses smart sensors, microcontrollers, and cloud monitoring to detect abnormal electricity usage in real-time and send alerts to utility providers.  

The system aims to:
- Detect electricity theft automatically  
- Reduce energy losses and revenue loss for utility companies  
- Improve billing accuracy and transparency  
- Enhance grid reliability and stability  


About Me
I am Odunayo Lydia, a final-year Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in IoT, embedded systems, and smart energy solutions. My academic training has equipped me with skills in electronics, programming (Python & C), hardware-software integration, and data analysis.  

I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, especially in energy management.
